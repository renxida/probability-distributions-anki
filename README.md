# Cedar's Big Anki Deck of Probability Distributions

Anki deck for reviewing probability distributions, with cards for:

- Name->Mean
- Name->Variance
- Name<->CDF
- Name<->PMF
- Name<->PDF
- Name->Explanation

`generate.py` goes to wikipedia and scrapes a whole bunch of probability distributions, turns the data into an anki deck, and saves into `CedarsProbabilityDistributions.apkg`. Thanks [Kerrick Staley](https://github.com/kerrickstaley) for making [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki).
